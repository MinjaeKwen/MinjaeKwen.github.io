<strong>Title</strong>
Time-domain ab initio analysis of facet-dependent carrier dynamics in Cuprous oxide

<strong>Laboratory and Advisor</strong>
M-design Laboratory, Pf. Hyungjun Kim

<strong>Introduction</strong>
Investigate facet-dependent charge carrier dynamics in Cu<sub>2</sub>O using semiclassical nonadiabatic dynamics simulations

<strong>Results and others</strong>
To be presented in poster session of ISTCP 2024 (<a href="Minjae_Kwen_Abstract_ISTCP.pdf">Abstract</a>)

In addition to using Poole as its foundation, Celeste is also built using the following open-source projects:

* [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), a modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/), the iconic font and CSS toolkit.
* [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/), a collection of CSS3 powered hover effects. 

Celeste is <i class="fa fa-code"></i> with <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> by [@nicoelayda](https://github.com/nicoelayda). Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/nicoelayda/celeste).
