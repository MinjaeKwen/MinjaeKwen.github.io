</p>

I am an undergraduate student in the <a href="https://chem.kaist.ac.kr/eng">chemistry department of KAIST</a>. As an undergraduate researcher, I actively participated in the research at the <a href="https://www.m-design-lab.net/">M-design Laboratory</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://chem.kaist.ac.kr/eng/faculty/view/id/20">Pf. Hyungjun Kim</a>.

            <strong>Research</strong>
      </a>
</p>

My research interest is primarily in <strong>computational chemistry</strong> with a focus on <i>ab-initio</i> quantum calculations, particularly <strong>Density Functional Theory(DFT)</strong>. I have studied catalytic systems and explored the mechanisms to improve catalytic efficiency. Currently, I am working on <strong>nonadiabatic dynamics simulations</strong>, including surface hopping, to better understand photon-related reactions and carrier dynamics. 

In addition, I have experience in nanocatalyst synthesis and electrochemical system design. For more details about my research, please visit the <strong><a href="https://minjaekwen.github.io/research/">"research"</a></strong> section of this website.

      <strong>Other Experiences</strong>
</p>

As an alternative military service, I worked at <a href="https://dangaram-k.goegh.kr/dangaram-k/main.do"><strong>Dangaram Kindergarten</strong></a> from May 2022 to February 2024. I cared for children with developmental disabilities and mental disorders. I received a <a href="/files/Certificate_of_Commendation.pdf"><strong>Certificate of Commendation</strong></a> for praising for faithful social service. This experience taught me how to approach challenges with a positive mindset.

I have been actively involved in <a href="/files/Certificate_of_Volunteer(Feb2019-Feb2024).pdf"><strong>volunteer work</strong></a> since middle school. Throughout my time at university, I have consistently volunteered over 30 hours each year.

I enjoy playing and watching sports, especially baseball. I was a member of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kaistrookiesbb.1986/"><strong>KAIST baseball club "Rookie"</strong></a>, for two years.
