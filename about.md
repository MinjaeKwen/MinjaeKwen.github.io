      <strong>Research</strong>
</p>

My research interest is primarily in <strong>computational chemistry</strong> with a focus on <i>ab-initio</i> quantum calculations, particularly <strong>Density Functional Theory(DFT)</strong>. I have studied catalytic systems and explored the mechanisms to improve catalytic efficiency. Currently, I am working on <strong>nonadiabatic dynamics simulations</strong>, including surface hopping, to better understand photon-related reactions and carrier dynamics.<br>
In addition, I have experience in nanocatalyst synthesis and electrochemical system design. For more details about my research, please visit the <strong><a href="https://minjaekwen.github.io/research/">"research"</a></strong> section of this website.

      <strong>Other Experiences</strong>
</p>

As an alternative military service, I worked at <strong>Dangaram Kindergarten</strong> from May 2022 to February 2024. I cared for children with developmental disabilities and mental disorders. I received a <a href="/files/Certificate_of_Commendation.pdf"><strong>Certificate of Commendation</strong></a> for praising for faithful social service. This experience taught me how to approach challenges with a positive mindset. <br>
I have been actively involved in <strong>volunteer work</strong> since middle school. Throughout my time at university, I have consistently volunteered over 30 hours each year. (<a href="/files/Certificate_of_Volunteer(Feb2019-Feb2024).pdf">"Certificate_of_Volunteer(Feb2019-Feb2024).pdf"</a>, Korean)<br>
I enjoy playing and watching sports, especially baseball. I was a member of the <strong>KAIST baseball club "Rookie",</strong> for two years.
