      <strong>I am <a href="/files/MinjaeKwen_CV.pdf">Minjae Kwen</a>.</strong>
</p>

I am an undergraduate student in the chemistry department of KAIST. As an undergraduate researcher, I actively participated in the research at the M-design Laboratory under the guidance of Pf. Hyungjun Kim. 

My research interest is primarily in <strong>computational chemistry</strong> with a focus on <i>ab-initio</i> quantum calculations, particularly <strong>Density Functional Theory(DFT)</strong>. I have studied catalytic systems and explored the mechanisms to improve catalytic efficiency. Currently, I am working on <strong>nonadiabatic dynamics simulations</strong>, including surface hopping, to better understand photon-related reactions and carrier dynamics.<br>
In addition, I have experience in nanocatalyst synthesis and electrochemical system design. For more details about my research, please visit the <strong><a href="https://www.minjaekwen.github.io/research/">"research"</a></strong> section of this website.

As an alternative military service, I worked at Dangaram Kindergarten from May 2022 to February 2024. I cared for children with mental disorders and developmental disabilities. This experience taught me how to approach difficulties with a positive mindset. <br>
I enjoy playing and watching sports, especially baseball. I was a member of the KAIST baseball club, Rookie, for two years.
