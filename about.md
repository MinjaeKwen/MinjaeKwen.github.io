I am <a href="/files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf">Minjae Kwen</a>.

I am an undergraduate student in the chemistry department of KAIST. As an undergraduate researcher, I actively participated in the research at the M-design Laboratory. My research advisor is Pf. Hyungjun Kim at KAIST. 

My research interest is primarily in <strong>computational chemistry</strong>. I am familiar with <i>ab-initio</i> quantum calculation, especially <strong>Density Functional Theory(DFT)</strong>. I have researched the catalytic system and investigated the mechanisms that enhance the catalytic efficiencies. Currently, I am studying <strong>nonadiabatic dynamics simulations</strong>, including surface hopping, which helps the understanding of photon-related reactions and carrier dynamics.

I have various research experiences in different laboratories and believe this can help my understanding for better
