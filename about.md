<p style="font-size: 150%;">
      <strong>I am <a href="/files/MinjaeKwen_CV.pdf">Minjae Kwen</a>.</strong>
</p>

I am an undergraduate student in the chemistry department of KAIST. As an undergraduate researcher, I actively participated in the research at the M-design Laboratory. My research advisor is Pf. Hyungjun Kim at KAIST. 

My research interest is primarily in <strong>computational chemistry</strong>. I am familiar with <i>ab-initio</i> quantum calculation, especially <strong>Density Functional Theory(DFT)</strong>. I have researched the catalytic system and investigated the mechanisms that enhance the catalytic efficiencies. Currently, I am studying <strong>nonadiabatic dynamics simulations</strong>, including surface hopping, which helps the understanding of photon-related reactions and carrier dynamics.

Here are more details about my life!<br>
