      <strong>I am <a href="/files/MinjaeKwen_CV.pdf">Minjae Kwen</a>.</strong>
</p>

I am an undergraduate student in the <a href="https://chem.kaist.ac.kr/eng">chemistry department of KAIST</a>, actively engaged in research at the <a href="https://www.m-design-lab.net/">M-design Laboratory</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://chem.kaist.ac.kr/eng/faculty/view/id/20">Professor Hyungjun Kim</a>.

            <strong>Research</strong>
      </a>
</p>

My primary research interest lies in <strong>computational chemistry</strong> focusing on <i>ab initio</i> quantum calculations, especially <strong>Density Functional Theory (DFT)</strong>. I have investigated catalytic systems, analyzing reaction mechanisms to enhance catalytic efficiency. I am currently conducting nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, including surface hopping techniques, to gain deeper insights into photon-induced reactions and carrier dynamics.

Additionally, I have hands-on experience in nanocatalyst synthesis and electrochemical system design. For more details, please visit the <strong><a href="https://minjaekwen.github.io/research/">"Research"</a></strong> section.

      <strong>Academic Experiences</strong>
</p>

At KAIST, I major in <strong>Chemistry</strong> and minor in <strong>Material Science</strong>. 
I additionally took courses in the Physics and Computer Science departments which improved my academic skills.
My total GPA is 4.18/4.3 for seven semesters.

Also, I've actively participated in academic conferences. Here are the lists of the conferences I attended.
* 2024 Korea-Japan Symposium on Molecular Science, Busan, Republic of Korea
* NANO KOREA 2024, Goyang-si, Republic of Korea
* ISTCP 2024, Qingdao, China (<i>Planned</i>)

I am familiar with the Linux environment for program development. Python, C++, and Shell script are my primary languages. I also experienced various languages or systems, such as JAVA, HTML, etc.

      <strong>Other Experiences</strong>
</p>

As an alternative military service, I worked at <a href="https://dangaram-k.goegh.kr/dangaram-k/main.do"><strong>Dangaram Kindergarten</strong></a> from May 2022 to February 2024. I cared for children with developmental disabilities and mental disorders. I received a <a href="/files/Certificate_of_Commendation.pdf"><strong>Certificate of Commendation</strong></a> for praising for faithful social service. This experience taught me how to approach challenges with a positive mindset.

I have been actively involved in <a href="/files/Certificate_of_Volunteer(Feb2019-Feb2024).pdf"><strong>volunteer work</strong></a> since middle school. Throughout my time at university, I have consistently volunteered over 30 hours each year.

I enjoy playing and watching sports, especially baseball. I was a member of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kaistrookiesbb.1986/"><strong>KAIST baseball club "Rookie"</strong></a>, for two years.
