      <strong>I am <a href="/files/MinjaeKwen_CV.pdf">Minjae Kwen</a>.</strong>
</p>

I am an undergraduate student in the chemistry department of KAIST. As an undergraduate researcher, I actively participated in the research at the M-design Laboratory. My research advisor is Pf. Hyungjun Kim at KAIST. 

My research interest is primarily in <strong>computational chemistry</strong>. I am familiar with <i>ab-initio</i> quantum calculation, especially <strong>Density Functional Theory(DFT)</strong>. I have researched the catalytic system and investigated the mechanisms that enhance the catalytic efficiencies. Currently, I am studying <strong>nonadiabatic dynamics simulations</strong>, including surface hopping, which helps the understanding of photon-related reactions and carrier dynamics.<br>
I also have research experience in nanocatalyst synthesis and electrochemical system design. If you want to know about my research experiences more, please visit the <strong><a href="https://www.minjaekwen.github.io/research/">"research"</a></strong> section of this website.

As an alternative to military service, I worked in the Dangaram Kindergarten from May 2022 to Feb 2024. I took care of children with mental disorders or developmental disabilities. During this period, I learned the way to overcome the difficulties with the positive mindset. <br>
I like playing and watching sports, especially baseball. I was in the baseball club of the KAIST, Rookie for two years.
