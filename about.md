      <strong>I am <a href="/files/MinjaeKwen_CV.pdf">Minjae Kwen</a>.</strong>
</p>

I am an undergraduate student in the <a href="https://chem.kaist.ac.kr/eng">chemistry department of KAIST</a>, actively conducting research in the <a href="https://www.m-design-lab.net/">M-design Laboratory</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://chem.kaist.ac.kr/eng/faculty/view/id/20">Professor Hyungjun Kim</a>.

            <strong>Research</strong>
      </a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My primary research interest lies in <strong>computational chemistry</strong> focusing on <i>ab initio</i> quantum calculations, especially <strong>Density Functional Theory (DFT)</strong>. I have investigated catalytic systems, analyzing reaction mechanisms to enhance catalytic efficiency. I am currently conducting nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, including surface hopping techniques, to gain deeper insights into photon-induced reactions and carrier dynamics.
<br><br>
Additionally, I have hands-on experience in nanocatalyst synthesis and electrochemical system design. For more details, please visit the <strong><a href="https://minjaekwen.github.io/research/">"Research"</a></strong> section.

      <strong>Academic Experiences</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
At KAIST, I major in <strong>Chemistry</strong> with a minor in <strong>Material Science</strong>. 
I have also taken additional courses in the Physics and Computer Science departments, which have improved my interdisciplinary skills. 
My cumulative GPA is <strong>4.18/4.3</strong> over seven semesters.
<br><br>
For my overseas experiences, I visited <strong>UC Berkeley Summer Session</strong> in 2019.
In 2020, I also visited <strong>IIT Madras, Chennai, India</strong> to exchange creative ideas with IITM students.
</p>

I have actively participated in several academic conferences, expanding my knowledge and networks in the field:
* 2024 Korea-Japan Symposium on Molecular Science, Busan, Republic of Korea
* NANO KOREA 2024, Goyang-si, Republic of Korea
* ISTCP 2024, Qingdao, China (<i>Planned</i>)
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in the Linux environment for program development. 
My primary programming languages include Python, C++, and Shell script, with additional experience in other languages such as JAVA and HTML.

      <strong>Other Experiences</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For my alternative military service, I worked at <a href="https://dangaram-k.goegh.kr/dangaram-k/main.do">Dangaram Kindergarten</a> from May 2022 to February 2024. I cared for children with developmental disabilities and mental disorders. I received a <a href="/files/Certificate_of_Commendation.pdf"><strong>Certificate of Commendation</strong></a> for my dedicated social service. This experience helped me develop resilience and a positive approach to challenges.
<br><br>
I have been consistently involved in <a href="/files/Certificate_of_Volunteer(Feb2019-Feb2024).pdf"><strong>volunteer work</strong></a> since middle school. 
I have consistently volunteered over 30 hours each year during my time at university.
<br><br>
I am passionate about sports, particularly baseball. I was a member of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kaistrookiesbb.1986/"><strong>KAIST baseball club "Rookie"</strong></a> for two years.
